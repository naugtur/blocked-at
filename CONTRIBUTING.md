# blocked-at is an OPEN Open Source Project

-----------------------------------------

## What?

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. Changes ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style. (run `npm start`)

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
